# Fixtures and Constants

Currently the assets and networks fixtures are really app constants here in the
fixtures directory. These will be turned into models later but will remain data
fixtures for the purpose of unit testing and bootstrapping the database in what
ever environment this runs in.

The trades fixtures are just data fixtures for unit testing.
